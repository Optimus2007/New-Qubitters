TEAM NEW-QUBITTERSD,
During the last 48 hours, this team had work extremely hard and communicated well to get the most efficient result possible in phase 1 and phase 2 of this Hackathon problem.
The Team planned to use QAOA for the QC-MTS in hopes of achieveing higher accuracy and lower auto-correlation. 

Furthermore, We included QMF due to a paper, a member of our team found which 
could optimize the code and get even better results for larger datasets as it searches the lowest energy in one go. 

We will be pushing the Following files in our submission:
1. READ ME SUBMISSION
2. NQ-PHASE2 SUBMISSION ( The final code submitted for the hackathon problem)
3. NQ PRESENTATION (for our code)
4.ai_report inside phase2_readme
